# Hi there, I'm Nicolas AssÃ©o ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate at **Ã‰cole Polytechnique**, passionate about building intelligent systems and robust software solutions. My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, full-stack development, and computer graphics.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Currently Focused On

* **Artificial Intelligence:** Developing and generalizing AI agents using frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph.
* **Full-Stack Development:** Engineering secure and scalable web applications with Next.js, Python, and AWS.
* **Computer Graphics and Video Games:** Exploring shader programming and rendering techniques while delving into Godot and 2D game creation.

### âœ¨ Experience & Projects

* **Current work on my Travel Planner:** when learning Next-JS, I followed along a tutorial to make a Travel Planner App. I am now adding AI functionality in it to add my own touch to this project.
* **AI Development Intern @ Foris (Current):** Generalizing a rule-generating AI agent for full integration into the company's workflow. Working in Spanish. Main tech: LangChain & LangGraph [LangChain course](https://github.com/nicolasasseo?tab=repositories) and [LangGraph course](https://github.com/nicolasasseo/LangGraph-CrashCours).
* **Software Engineer Intern @ Genial AI:** Developed a full-stack, secure gateway to query open-source LLMs, reducing API costs for this use case. Used [Next](https://github.com/nicolasasseo/OpenSource_LLM_Wrapper) initially and refactored to [Python FastAPI](https://github.com/nicolasasseo/llm-fast-api) for easy integration.
* **Research Project @ LIX (Ã‰cole Polytechnique):** Implemented implicit texturing techniques for 3D models using JavaScript and GLSL.
* **Founder @ SosToMaths:** Created and launched a platform to help middle-schoolers with mathematics, growing the user base to 3,000 students.
* **Machine Learning Credit Risk Analysis:** final project for my Machine Learning class where we implemented many different ML algorithms to study a Kaggle dataset. [See here](https://github.com/nicolasasseo/Credit_Risk_Analysis)
* **Godot 2D Games:** built in the context of my Video Game Dev class in Chile. Built one simple platformer alone [KnightStomp](https://github.com/nicolasasseo/KnightStomp). Also did a group project where we built a game based around teleporters.
